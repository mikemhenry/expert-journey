        <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄÇVerifying the bug</h3>

        Before submitting a report, please verify that:

        1. The issue you are experiencing is in fact a bug,
        and not a documented expected behavior.

        2. The bug is reproducible in the latest version of the software,
        and has not yet been reported.

        <blockquote>
            üí° <a href="{}"><b>Open a discussion instead!</b></a>
            <br>
            This verification process is non-trivial, and can be time-consuming.
            If you are not a collaborator and don't have the time to go through the process,
            you can always open a discussion instead; we will investigate the problem as soon as possible,
            and convert the discussion into an issue if the bug is verified.
        </blockquote>
        <h3>ü§ù‚ÄÇCode of conduct</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          Please make sure that you are following our
          <a href="{metadata[urls][github][code_of_conduct]}">Code of Conduct</a>,
