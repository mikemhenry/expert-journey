## Creating Releases

### Background
GitHub's own Action for creating new releases, called [create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release),
has been archived on 2021, and is currently not maintained.
Instead, some of the currently most popular Actions are:
* [Release Drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter)
* Google [release-please-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-please-action)
* [GH Release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gh-release)
* [Create Release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-release)
* [Automatic Releases](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/automatic-releases)

* [laminas/automatic-releases](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/laminas-automatic-releases)

### Creating Changelogs
There are also Actions that only specialize in creating Changelogs for releases:
* [Release Changelog Builder](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-changelog-builder)
